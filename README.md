# 🌪️ Atlantic Hurricanes Analysis (Excel Project)

Welcome to my data-driven exploration of the **Biggest Atlantic Hurricanes**—a structured Excel workbook that transforms historical storm data into meaningful insights. This project showcases my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize complex datasets using Excel’s full analytical toolkit.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This workbook dives into the most powerful hurricanes recorded in the Atlantic, analyzing their wind speeds, damage levels, and affected regions. By combining formulas, pivot tables, and structured referencing, I’ve built a scalable framework for understanding storm intensity and impact.

- **📊 Data Structuring & Cleaning**
  - Organized raw hurricane data into usable formats
  - Applied filters and sorting to surface key metrics

- **📈 Comparative Analysis**
  - Ranked hurricanes by wind speed and damage
  - Flagged high-impact storms for further review

- **📤 Reporting & Dashboard Design**
  - Created summary views for quick insights
  - Used conditional formatting to highlight extremes

---

## 🔗 Cell Referencing

- Used **absolute and relative references** to build dynamic formulas across sheets
- Linked summary tables to raw data using structured references
- Applied **named ranges** for clarity and formula reusability

---

## 🧮 Functions & Formulas

- Applied core functions including:
  - `MAX`, `MIN`, `AVERAGE`, `IF`, `COUNTIF`, `RANK`
  - `SWITCH` for formatting and logic
